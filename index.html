	<h1>Projects @sebastiannjose</h1>
	<p>Once in a while, I spare some time to work on personal projects that I will eventually share. They are outlined here on my Github page.</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>apphive</li>
	    <li>élevet (eleve - student, t - tracker)</li>
	    <li>offerte (groupon deals)</li>
	    <li>pícaro</li>
	    <li>roguebox (enhanced version of picaro)</li>
	    <li>socialwink</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A bit ambitious you might think, however, please do remember, Rome was not built in one day. I can relate to dozens of great software packages and libraries hosted on Github that we have unknowingly fallen in love with.</p>
